## Running simulation
The simulation can be ran using the run.bat or run.sh scripts.
In the file parameters.json the various simulation settings may be changed.

## Parameters file
The file parameters.json contains the simulations configuration.
There are two mandatory nodes: simulation settings and viewer settings.
The missiles and defences can be added and removed at will.
The type of missile or defence is determined by the node name, so: "default missile 1"
will create an instance of a default missile.
